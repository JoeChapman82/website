    "p1": "Two of the most useful things I find when creating and debuging a game are and FPS counter and an output of how long the main game loop is taking to execute. It can be a great indicator of when things have been pushed too far and is great for finetuning variables towards the end of development, such as particle amounts for explosions.",

    "p3": "First we'll need a few variables. We'll start by grabbing the canvas element, it's context for drawing on and another variable to use for canceling the main game loop",
    "p4": "Well also need a variables to compare times against, for storing the frames per second count, and finally delta time which is commonly used to represent the time between two frames",
    "p5": "Now we'll create the main draw loop and add a couple of methods to clear the canvas and render a little background",
    "p6": "All that's left is to caluclate the times assign them to variables and render them on the screen. For that, we'll just need a couple more methods",
